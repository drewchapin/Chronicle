This is a keylogger that I originally wrote in 2004, and have modified many times since then. The application runs silently in the 
background capturing all key presses on the keyboard and saves them to a log file for later review. 

### WARNING / DISCLAIMER
Keyloggers can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Using Keyloggers (maliciously or not) may be an illegal act 
according to your local, state, or federal laws. I assume no liability and cannot be held responsible for any damage or misuse of 
this software source code.
